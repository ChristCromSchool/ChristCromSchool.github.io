            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <h3>Professional Development and ePortfolio Reflection</h3>

        <p>Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative journey in shaping my professional goals and values. The combination of technical coursework, hands-on projects, and the creation of my ePortfolio has provided me with a comprehensive platform to showcase my strengths and prepare for a successful career in the computer science field. Through this experience, I have gained valuable insights into key areas such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, working with data structures and algorithms, applying software engineering principles, and understanding the importance of security in software development. I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with peers on various projects, which enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team environment. I’ve also gained experience communicating with stakeholders, ensuring that I can gather requirements and translate them into technical solutions. My coursework has deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, allowing me to solve complex problems efficiently. Additionally, my work in software engineering and database management has given me the skills to design and maintain scalable systems, while my focus on security has equipped me with the knowledge to build secure applications that protect users’ data. Overall, 
            these experiences have prepared me to enter the workforce as a capable and adaptable software developer, ready to contribute to team projects, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and build high-quality software solutions.</p>
            <p>For my ePortfolio, I’ve selected a project from my CS-465 course that demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and enhance a web application. This Angular-based trip management application allows users to view and manage trip information stored in a database. The project includes user authentication, and admin users can add or edit trips through dynamic forms that update the database in real time via HTTP requests using JSON files.</p>

            <p>When I first built this application about three months ago, the core functionality was in place: users could log in, and admins could edit or add trips. The original authentication system allowed users to log in and access the trip data, and the admin role provided access to the functionality for modifying the database. However, I knew that I could make the application more robust, secure, and user-friendly by adding several enhancements.</p>

            <h3>Adding Testing</h3>
            <p>The first major improvement I made was adding extensive testing to ensure the application’s reliability. Initially, the application was functional, but I realized that comprehensive testing was necessary to catch potential issues early and ensure the app worked as expected in various scenarios. I used Karma and Jasmine, which integrate seamlessly with Angular, to set up unit tests for the application’s components and services.</p>

            <p>I focused on testing key features like authentication and trip management. For example, I created a suite of tests for the AuthenticationService, which handled user login and registration. The tests ensured that the authentication process worked correctly and could handle both successful and failed login attempts. I also tested edge cases, such as invalid inputs and network failures, to make sure the app would behave as expected in all situations. This step not only made the app more reliable but also helped me sharpen my skills in error handling and testing.</p>

            <h3>Enhancing Authentication with Google OAuth2</h3>
            <p>Once I had implemented testing, I turned my attention to improving the authentication system. While the original login allowed users to authenticate and access the app, I wanted to add an additional layer of security and convenience by integrating Google OAuth2. This would allow users to log in using their Google accounts, eliminating the need for the app to store passwords.</p>

            <p>I integrated the Google OAuth2 authentication process, which involved using tokens for secure login. The backend was updated to validate these tokens, ensuring that only authorized users could access the app. This change not only improved security but also provided a smoother user experience, as users could log in with their existing Google credentials. This was a significant improvement over the original login system, and it aligned with modern best practices for user authentication.</p>

            <h3>Implementing Search and Pagination</h3>
            <p>With the core authentication and testing in place, I turned to improving the user experience. One area that needed attention was the search functionality. The app originally allowed users to view trips, but finding specific trips in a large dataset could be time-consuming. To address this, I added a search feature that utilized a Trie (prefix tree) data structure for autocomplete functionality.</p>

            <p>The Trie allows the app to quickly retrieve suggestions based on the user’s input, making the search process faster and more intuitive. I also implemented pagination to handle large datasets more efficiently. Initially, the app loaded all the trip data at once, which could slow down the interface as the dataset grew. With pagination, the app now retrieves only the data needed for the current page, significantly improving performance. Sorting functionality was also added, allowing users to sort trips by name or date, further enhancing the app’s usability.</p>

            <h3>Adding Cart and Stripe Integration</h3>
            <p>Finally, I added a new feature to the application: a shopping cart and Stripe payment integration. This was a significant expansion of the project’s scope, and it allowed users to select trips and make payments through the Stripe payment gateway.</p>

            <p>The cart functionality was implemented by adding a service that tracked the selected trips, allowing users to view and modify their selections before proceeding to checkout. The Stripe integration involved setting up a secure payment process that allowed users to enter their payment information and complete transactions. This feature required careful attention to security, as sensitive payment data needed to be handled securely and comply with Stripe’s guidelines.</p>

            <h3>Challenges and Future Improvements</h3>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I faced several challenges, particularly with setting up the correct data structures and ensuring that the app’s different components communicated effectively. For instance, when adding pagination and sorting, I had to carefully manage how data was retrieved from the backend to ensure that only the necessary records were loaded. Additionally, implementing Google OAuth2 authentication required me to learn about token-based authentication and how to securely manage user sessions.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead, I plan to expand the app further by adding additional features, such as an extended database to store more detailed trip information and additional payment options. I also intend to continue improving the app’s security and testing coverage, ensuring that it remains scalable and secure as new features are added.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project demonstrates my ability to take an initial concept and enhance it through iterative improvements. By adding comprehensive testing, improving authentication, optimizing search and pagination, and integrating a payment system, I’ve created a more robust, user-friendly, and secure application. These enhancements reflect my ability to apply algorithmic principles, use modern tools and techniques, and ensure that my applications meet the highest standards of quality and security. This project is a strong example of my skills as a software developer and my commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
